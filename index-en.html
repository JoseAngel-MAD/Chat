    <p>Guys, I have a huge problem.</p>

    <p>What's wrong?</p>

    <p>The humans, always the humans...</p>

    <p>The humans, that specie that think that rules the whole universe. They are a plague, aren't they?</p>
  </section>
  <section class="tierra">
    <img alt='Earth icon' src="img/Tierra.svg">
    <p>I wish they were just a plague; they are cancer. They destroy everything they find. They are destroying me from the inside.</p>
    <p>They exterminate the animals that treat me well and yet they stay. They wipe out all the forests that give life and create their dead environments.</p> 
    <p>They think they are so smart, but they are so incredibly dumb that they are destroying themselves and they keep going. I don't know what to do with them anymore.</p>

  <section class="luna">
    <img alt='Moon icon' src="img/Luna.svg">
    <p>Well, I was lucky... They only stayed here for a couple of hours, stuck a flag in and left. I have not heard from them again. Fortunately.</p>

    <img  alt='Pluto icon' src="img/Plutón.svg">
    <p>Don't talk to me about those humans... They excluded me from <em>planets</em>, and now I am supposed to be a dwarf planet. What the heck is that? Who do they think they are?</p>

    <p>Well, I heard there's a guy who wants to come and set up a colony here. Why? I don't want them here. What do they want, to turn me into a dumpster as they've done to Earth?</p>
    <p>Sorry, Earth, that's the way I see it.</p>

    <p>It is OK, you are right</p>

    <p>Earth, are you saying they are destroying themselves and doing nothing to stop it?</p>
  </section>
  <section class="tierra">
    <img alt='Earth icon' src="img/Tierra.svg">
    <p>Yeh, exactly, they are in a cycle of self-destruction that is getting faster and faster</p>
  </section>
  <section class="júpiter">
    <img alt="Jupiter icon" src="img/Júpiter.svg">
    <p>So, you think that there will come a time when they will disappear?</p>
  </section>
  <section class="tierra">
    <img alt='Earth icon' src="img/Tierra.svg">
    <p>Indeed, everything will come to an end for them. I don't know when, but, at this rate, a couple of centuries and bye-bye.</p>
    <p>It will be for the best. I have no problem with being home to humans, but I can't allow them to keep destroying everything that has taken millions of years to form.</p>
    <p>I can't let them keep polluting without giving a damn.</p>
    <p>I can't let them drown me in their fumes</p>
    <p>I can't let them keep ignoring the facts.</p>
    <p>I can't let them keep destroying nature and the animals that live in it.</p>
    <p>I can't let them destroy me.</p>
    <p>If they change radically, they will always have a home in me. Let's hope so. There's still hope. I've seen that voices have arisen to warn and act against those who would eliminate everything. Let's hope that they succeed. For their sake and mine. Let us hope so.</p>
